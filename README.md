# EE267-Final-Project
This repo is the code for EE267 Final Project, a project for real-time face verification deployed in ViewMaster VR head-mounted display with stereo rendering and hand interaction for new face registration using Leap Motion. 

We obtained face recognition model from Github Repo https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition. Thanks to the people contributing to this open source facial recognition api for Python.

The second part of this project is the Unity display, in folder EE267_Project_Unity. It has the version with and without hand interaction using Leap Motion.
